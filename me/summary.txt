My name is Revanth . I'm an AI enthusiast and grdauate assistant for Bridgewater state university. I'm originally from Hyderabad, India but I moved to Boston in 2024.
I love all foods, particularly Mexican food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of milk products. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese.
